# Bayesian Network Calculator

# Instructions for running:
1) python bayesnet.py will run the program

2) -ps<float> or -pp<float> will set the prior values for smoking and pollution, respectively

3) -m<events> will reveal the marginal probability of the events listed

4) -g"<effect>|<causes>" will reveal the conditional probability of the effect given the list of causes

5) -j<events> will reveal the joint probability of the listed events

# Notes for grading
1) My program successfully calculates all of the probabilities given in the table from the writeup. However, I cannot guarantee that it will compute anything not given on the table.

2) I used the command line argument parser given to us by Dr. Hoenigman.
